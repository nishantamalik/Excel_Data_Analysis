# Excel_Data_Analysis_Example
I have used sample data in excel to perform the below operations:
Quick statistics
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with CF
Sales by country (with formulas)
Sales by country (with pivots)
Top 5 products by $ per unit
Are there any anomalies in the data?
Best Sales person by country
Profits by product (using products table) - See column Y
Dynamic country-level Sales Report
Which products to discontinue?

The data set was shared by Chandoo(Youtube Channel).
